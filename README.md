A blazing fast Steam Client in Node.js with the smallest overhead possible while keeping the code simple, and readable. No libraries have been imported to make the Steam connection, this was done in pure Node.js.
If you are looking for a complete Steam Client implementation, this is not it. However, if you are looking for a base to start your own project and value performance, and like TypeScript, then this is it.

Connection to Steam is done via Steam CM WebSockets or TCP.
Connecting via HTTP and Socks v5 proxies are supported.
